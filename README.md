Wallet Payment Network Management Database Management

Users can sign up with WALLET (that is, create an account with WALLET) by providing
their name, SSN, an email address, and a phone number. Only one phone can be
recorded for each WALLET account, but a WALLET account can be associated with
multiple email addresses. Email addresses and phone numbers can be recorded in the
database but they should be verified before they can be used – i.e., a user should
prove that she owns an email address or a phone number by entering correctly the
code that is sent via email or SMS respectively. A user’s identity is confirmed if her
email addresses and phone number are verified. The system should be able to record
both verified and non-verified email addresses and phone numbers.
